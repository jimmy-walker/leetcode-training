Use lists unless you want some very specific features that are in the C array libraries.

python really has three primitive data structures.

```python
tuple = ('a','b','c')
list = ['a','b','c']
dict = {'a':1, 'b': true, 'c': "name"}
```

besides that , string： 字符串（即不能修改的字符list）

```python
str = “Hello My friend”
```
